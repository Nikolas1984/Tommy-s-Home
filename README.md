# Tommys-Home
A simple prototype created for a College Assignment called "Tommy's Home" , this game was made to showcase Gamemaker in practice for first semester students of Computer Science at Unasp , to shown them that is possible to make games if they're interested.

Attached to this repository is a simple GDD and a presentation introducing the basics of the Gamemaker Engine.
